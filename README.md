### There are two applications client in the project: VelibClientConsole and VelibClientWinform

#### VelibClientConsole
  Once the application is excuted, the console window prints the description of utilisation at first. Then you should input the city and the station according to the questions. If the city/station is wrong, it will prompt that "No such city/station". If you input "help", it will prints once again the description of utilisation.

#### VelibClientWinform
There is a menu of help at the left top of the window. A window of description will be showed by clicking.
